        <h1>A global picture of the EV market</h1>
         <i><font color="grey">Tiny share yet impressive growth!</font></i>
         <p> According to the IEA, only around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17 000</a> electric vehicles (EV) were on the road globally in 2010. 
            In 2019 this number climbed up to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">4.79 million</a>! That is more than a steady 180% increase year-on-year! 
            Yet, globally, there are more than <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world-70629">1 billion</a>  cars in use which makes the EV fleet less than half a percent. 
            Still, this impressive growth over the past 10 years raises big questions for the future. 
            When will electric surpasses combustion vehicles? Which EV model is selling best? Can gas stations switch to charging stations at the same pace? 
            What does it take to accelerate or decelerate this transition? Which countries are ahead in EV deployments? </p>
            <p>Well, it turns out that there are humongous disparities in the growth of EVs across the globe. Take a look at 2018 car sales. Look at how Norway is way ahead in EV sales share!

         <h1>Closer look at Norway</h1>
            <i><font color="grey">Secret recipe to EV fertility</font></i>
            <p>Such a feet in respect of global performance raises questions on how it can be achieved. First and foremost, lets look at the top EV models sold in Norway.</p>
            <p>plot_top_evm.html PLOT HERE</p>
            <P>Nissan Leaf started 10 years ago so it benefits from the top spot compared to the notorious Tesla model 3 which made its debuts a year ago (only!). 
               It is obvious that there must be a reason behind these numbers. 
               Are Norwegians extremely concerned about the environment? 
               Well not more than their neighbour countries (Greta is not Norwegian). 
               Additionally, Norway is the EU member which produces the most petrol in Europe! So what is the secret? Well ... </P>
            <i><center>Pricetag!</center></i>
            <p>When it comes down to choosing a new car, EVs are still significantly more expensive with respect their fossil fuel counterparts. 
               But thanks to government policies this does not have to be the case everywhere. 
               Indeed, at the time where quasi no EVs could be found on the roads, a whole series of government policies were set in place in Norway. 
               The most significant two were:</p>
               <ul type="square">
                  <li>1991: The <b>“one time fee”</b> roughly doubled the price of each car except EVs</li>
                  <li>2001: A <b>VAT exemption</b> was allocated to EVs</li>
               </ul>
            <p>Yet with all these measures, it took another 10 years until the EV growth started to kick in. 
               And compared to the rest of the world, this fleet share growth is simply put, jaw dropping. </p>

         <h1>Let’s start digging </h1>
            <i><font color="grey">Python is our favourite shovel</font></i>
            <p>The plot above raises some interesting concerns. What triggered the sudden growth of EV sales in Norway and what sustains it? 
               Lets start by analysing the consumer behaviour in respect to switching from dirty gasoline to “clean” electric into four categories which can directly influence their choice. </p>
            <p>Now that we have these categories, how do we assess which category affects the most the decision of consumers? </p>
            <h1>Google trends</h1>
            <i>Google never lies</i>
            <p>Why not investigate what consumers search for on the web before they buy an electric vehicle? 
               The idea will be to investigate search patterns within these four categories and align them Norway’s EV market share. 
               A Google has a ready made tool for that ! </p>
               <i><center>Google trends</center></i>
            <p>You can narrow historical data of search queries to a specific timespan and region. Up to 5 keywords can be compared among each other. 
               The values are on a scale of 0 to 100% where 100% is the data point for which a single keyword has been the most solicitated. 
               We have selected 5 keywords which, in our eyes, represent most the categories mentioned above. 
               The trends of these keywords are shown here. </p>
         <h1>Quantifying motivations to buy EV's</h1>
            <i><font color="grey">Put your money where your mouth is</font></i>
            <p>When trying to understand someones motivation to do anything the easiest thing to do is just ask them. In a study reported by
               <a href="https://news.cision.com/no/fortum-norge/r/10-grunner-til-at-nordmenn-onsker-a-kjope-elbil,c2560325">Fortum</a>, 
               Norwegians themselves report climate and environment as the main reasons for buying electric. But of course the moral high 
               ground is a pleasant place to be, or at least seem to be. There is wisdom in the old saying "Look at what a person does, not 
               what they say". If we are to understand what motivates EV-buyers it mght be better to let peoples own behaviour speak for itself.</p> 

            <p>Buying an electric car is usually not done on a whim, and some research is called for ahead of a purchase. Could peoples search 
               patterns on Google tell us about whats most important to them? If so, that means it is possible that their search patterns can be 
               used to better inform a prediction model for the evolution of EV market share.</p> 
            
            <p>Using google search patterns to improve prediction models 
               was demonstrated in a 2009 paper by Choi & Varian titled <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//googleblogs/pdfs/google_predicting_the_present.pdf">"Predicting the Present with Google Trends"</a>.
               The concept is quite simple. Add the search pattern data provided by Google Trends to an Auto Regressive (AR) model, and see if 
               this model is better at prediction compared to an AR model without Google Trends. If certain keywords from google search trends
               leads to better prediction, then that is a strong indicator of a very real motivation to buy electric.</p>
            
            <p>MAE AND AIC PLOT HERE</p>

            <p>In the above plot you see the performance metrics of 20 AR-models, each fitted with the Google Trends data signified by the
               keywords on the y-axis. On the left Akaike's Informatino Criterion (AIC) is displayed, which is a common metric to use in order
               to evaluate the in-sample performance of a model. A lower value of AIC signifies a better in-sample fit. However, in-sample fit 
               does not neccesarily lead to prediction efficacy on yet-unseen data. Displayed on the right is the percentage improvement for Mean 
               Absolute Error (MAE) from the baseline model to the AR model with keywords.</p>

            <p>However, individual performance does not neatly lead to combined performance. When using several keywords in the same model,
               some keywords that had good individual performance does not lead to an overall improvement, while some keywords with a lesser
               improvement combines very well with others. With some experimentation the highest MAE for one model is achieved using the 
               keywords "Electric vehicle fee", "Electric vehicle parking", "Electric vehicle price", "Tesla", "Nissan Leaf", with an MAE 
               improvement of 3.68%. The final model (green), and the baseline model (orange) is shown against empirical market share (blue)
               in the graph below. Predictions only start some time into 2011, because the period before that was used for in-sample training
               of the model.</p>

            <p>PREDICTION (WITH ZOOM?) HERE</p>

            <p>Only economic and EV-model specific keywords were used to obtain this model. Keywords concerning environment, such as "Carbon
               Footprint", despite showing good individual performance does not help improve a combined model much at all. This result is in 
               stark contrast to Norwegians self reported reasons for buying EV's. Could it be true? Is economic and EV-model enthusiasm the
               main driving factors leading people to buy EV's?</p>
